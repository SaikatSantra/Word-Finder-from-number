# Word-Finder-from-number

Based on the requirement, I noticed that “1-800-FLOWERS” translates to the number 1-800-3569377. That means FLOWERS = 3569377, where each letter corresponds to a digit on a phone keypad.

However, the task provided the number 3662277, and a dictionary of words:
["foo", "flowers", "bar", "foobar", "emo", "cap", "car", "cat", "far", "ra"]

I need to find all possible words from the dictionary that match parts of the number.

Here are the matches I found:

foo → 366 ✔

bar → 227 ✔

foobar → 366227 ✔

emo → 366 ✔

cap → 227 ✔

car → 227 ✔
